# Bit Operations Interactive Learning Tool

An interactive C program to learn and understand bitwise operators through practical examples.

## 🔍 Features

- Interactive menu-driven interface
- Color-coded output for better visualization
- Detailed examples for each bitwise operator:
  - AND (&)
  - XOR (^)
  - OR (|)
  - NOT (~)
  - Right Shift (>>)
  - Left Shift (<<)
- Clear explanations and real-time results
- Visual formatting with colors and styles

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd bit\ a\ bit
make
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the program:
```bash
./bit_a_bit
```

Select an option (1-6) to learn about different bitwise operators:
1. AND (&) - Learn about binary AND operations
2. XOR (^) - Understand exclusive OR operations
3. OR (|) - Explore binary OR operations
4. NOT (~) - See how bit inversion works
5. RIGHT SHIFT (>>) - Learn about right shift operations
6. LEFT SHIFT (<<) - Understand left shift operations

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of basic bitwise operations
- Visual representation of binary operations
- Practical examples with numerical results
- Mathematical equivalents for shift operations

## 🔧 Technical Details

- Written in C
- Uses ANSI color codes for formatting
- Includes Makefile for easy compilation
- Error handling for invalid inputs
